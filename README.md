The goal of the game is to create a mathematical expression that evaluates to 24 using the values of the four cards given. The expression can consist of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division. Parentheses can also be used to change the order of operations (ex. addition before multiplication, such as (1+2)*3). The expression used should NOT contain any spaces, otherwise a warning will be issued. If the user chooses, they can change the set of cards dealt by hitting the refresh button. Numbered cards have the same value as their number, Jack is worth 11, Queen is worth 12, King is worth 13, and Ace is worth 1.

The project was made using IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 with Java SDK 15.0.2. 

Below are instructions on how to set up JavaFX on IntelliJ, which is required to run the project. Alternatively you can watch the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ope4icw6bVk&ab_channel=BroCode

This project uses JavaFX SDK 11.0.2 which must be downloaded separately (https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). Once downloaded, you must select new JavaFX project in IntelliJ. Once created, click the folder containing the project name in the "Project" section on the left hand side of IntelliJ. Click "File" -> "Project Structure". Then click "Libraries" and hit the "+" symbol and find the extracted JavaFX SDK folder and hit "Ok". Apply it to the project. 

You will then need to head to: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/

Head to the portion involving IntelliJ and follow the direction at step 4: "Add VM Options" 

The program should now be able to run.
